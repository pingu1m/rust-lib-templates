Here's a sample `README.md` that you can use for your Rust library. This will provide basic information on how to set up the project, use the library, and run the examples included.

```markdown
# Your Crate Name

Description of your crate goes here. Explain what your library does and why it's useful.

## Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install Rust using the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url/your-crate.git
cd your-crate
```

### Using the Library

To use the library in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
your_crate = { path = "path_to_your_crate" }
```

### Running the Examples

This project includes several examples demonstrating how to use the library. You can run each example using Cargo:

#### Basic Usage Example

```bash
cargo run --example basic_usage
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `sample_function` provided by the library.

#### Division Example

```bash
cargo run --example division_example
```

This example shows how to handle division operations and error management in your applications.

## Documentation

For more details on each function and module, refer to the documentation generated by Rustdoc:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests, create issues, or provide feedback on how the library can be improved.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE) file for details.

### Notes:

1. **Repository URL**: Replace `https://your-repository-url/your-crate.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
2. **Dependency Path**: When instructing users to add the crate to their `Cargo.toml`, make sure the path `path_to_your_crate` is correctly set, especially if the crate is not yet published to crates.io.
3. **Customization**: Adjust the "Features", "Contributing", and other sections based on what your library offers and your plans for community involvement.

This `README.md` should provide a good starting point for users to understand and engage with your Rust library effectively.
